(19) ACCEPTANCE OF THE GOODS (Section 35)
- Acceptance is deemed to take place when the buyer:
1. intimates to the seller that he has accepted the goods; or
2. does any act to the goods which is inconsistent with the ownership of the seller; or
3. retains the goods, after the lapse of a reasonable time, without intimating to the seller that he
has rejected them.
- Section 34 - If the buyer has not previously examined the goods, he is deemed not to have accepted
them unless he has reasonable opportunity to examine them upon delivery.
(20) AN UNPAID SELLER (Section 38)
- The seller of goods is deemed to be an "unpaid seller”:
• when the whole of the price has not been paid or tendered;
• when a bill of exchange or other negotiable instrument has been received as conditional
payment, and the condition on which it was received has not been fulfilled by reason of the
dishonour of the instrument or otherwise.
(21) RIGHTS OF AN UNPAID SELLER (Section 39)
- Notwithstanding that the property in the goods may have passed to the buyer, the unpaid
seller of goods, has by implication of law-
1. a lien on the goods or right to retain them for the price while he is in possession of them;
2. in case of the insolvency of the buyer, a right of stopping the goods in transit after he has
parted with the possession of them;
3. a right of re-sale.
- Where the property in goods has not passed to the buyer, the unpaid seller has, in addition
to his other remedies, a right of withholding delivery similar to and co-extensive with his rights
of lien and stoppage in transit where the property has passed to the buyer.
- A lien (Section 40):
• A lien is a right to retain possession of goods until payment of the price.
• Section 41 - The unpaid seller loses his lien:
(a) when goods have been delivered to a carrier for the purpose of transmission to the buyer;
(b) when the buyer or his agent obtains possession of the goods lawfully;
(c) by waiver.
- Right of stoppage in transit (Section 43):
• The right of stopping the goods while they are on transit and retaining possession until the
payment is made.
• It is available when:
(a) the buyer becomes insolvent; and
(b) the goods are in transit
- Right of resale (Section 47):
• The exercise of the right of lien or stoppage does not rescind the contract.
• However, where an unpaid seller who has exercised his right of lien or retention or stoppage in
transit resells the goods, the buyer acquires a good title thereto as against the original buyer.
• The seller has the right to resell when:
(a) the goods are of a perishable nature; or
(b) when the unpaid seller gives notice to the buyer of his intention to resell and the buyer
does not within a reasonable time pay the price;
