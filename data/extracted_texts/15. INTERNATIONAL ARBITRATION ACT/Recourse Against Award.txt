International Arbitration Act 2020 Section 54
54 Additional award
(1) A party may request the arbitral tribunal within 30 days of receipt of an award,
unless otherwise agreed by the parties, to make an additional award as to claims
presented in the arbitral proceedings but omitted from the award.
(2) If the arbitral tribunal considers the request under sub-section (1) to be justified,
it shall make the additional award within 60 days.
(3) The arbitral tribunal may extend, if necessary, the period of time within which
it shall make an additional award under sub-section (2).
55 Costs of the arbitration
(1) For the purposes of sections 56 and 57, “costs of the arbitration” means —
(a) the arbitrators’ fees and expenses;
(b) the fees and expenses of any arbitral institution concerned; and
(c) the legal or other costs of the parties.
(2) Any such reference includes the costs of or incidental to any proceedings to
determine the amount of the recoverable costs of the arbitration.
56 Agreement to pay costs in any event
An agreement which has the effect that a party is to pay the whole or part of the costs
of the arbitration in any event is only valid if made after the dispute in question has
arisen.
57 Award of costs
(1) The arbitral tribunal may make an award allocating the costs of the arbitration
as between the parties, subject to any agreement of the parties.
(2) Unless the parties otherwise agree, the tribunal shall award costs on the general
principle that costs should follow the event except where it appears to the
tribunal that in the circumstances this is not appropriate in relation to the whole
or part of the costs.
PART 9 – RECOURSE AGAINST AWARD
58 Application for setting aside as exclusive recourse against arbitral
award

to Act 21 of 2020 Page 27
Section 58 International Arbitration Act 2020
(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the court only if –
(a) the party making the application furnishes proof that –
(i) a party to the arbitration agreement referred to in section 8 was
under some incapacity; or the said agreement is not valid under the
law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication
thereon, under the laws of Tonga;
(ii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of
the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or
was otherwise unable to present his case;
(iii) the award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling
within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains
decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to
arbitration, provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to
arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, only that
part of the award which contains decisions on matters not
submitted to arbitration may be set aside; or
(iv) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure
was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, unless
such agreement was in conflict with a provision of this Act from
which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was
not in accordance with this Act; or
(b) the court finds that—
(i) the subject matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by
arbitration under the laws of Tonga; or
(ii) the award is contrary to public policy in Tonga.
(3) An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have
elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received
the award or, if a request had been made under sections 53 and 54, from the
date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal.
(4) The court, when asked to set aside an award, may, where appropriate and so
requested by a party, suspend the setting aside proceedings for a period of time
determined by it in order to give the arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume
the arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the arbitral tribunal’s
opinion will eliminate the grounds for setting aside.
